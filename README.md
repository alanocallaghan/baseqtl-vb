# Case studies of approximate inference with Stan and BaseQTL

This repo contains the code used to create figures for
"Variational inference for eQTL discovery with BaseQTL".

You can use the (verbose) Snakefile as a guide to the scripts in the repo.
The scripts also have commandline flags that may be informative.

The Snakefile creates a lot of figures that were used for exploring the data.
The main figures used in the manuscript can be found using the "figure" rule.
